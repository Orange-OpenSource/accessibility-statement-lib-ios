## 🚀 Import Accessibility Statement lib in your project

1. To integrate the `DeclarationAccessibility` module into your Xcode project using _Swift Package Manager_, declare a new dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/accessibility-statement-lib-ios.git", .exact("2.0.0"))
```

2. Then add the dependency product in the target you want:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTargetName",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "DeclarationAccessibility", package: "accessibility-statement-lib-ios")
    ],
)
```

> [!TIP]
> You can of course refer to it in your Xcode project settings.

## 🚀 Usage

Import the module from the Swift Package:

```swift
import DeclarationAccessibility
```

Then, given an XML file generated by [La Va11ydette](https://la-va11ydette.orange.com/) named `accessibility_result` in your app bundle:

- Display the statement with additional details in local HTML file
```swift
StatementView(xmlFile: "accessibility_result", theme: .orange, localUrl: absoluteStringUrlToLocalFile)
```

- Or use a detailed page available outside the app, e.g. in web site, to display in webview or not (by default not)
```swift
StatementView(xmlFile: "accessibility_result", theme: .orange, remoteUrl:  "https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/fr/", useWebView: true)
```
